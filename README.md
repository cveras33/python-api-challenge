# Python API Challenge - What's the weather like? 

## Background ##

Using Python requests, APIs and JSON traversals, the following weather analysis answers the questsion __"What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"__. Using data from the [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api), the previously stated question is answered by getting data about 500+ world cities with varying distance from the equator, which is located at 0&deg; latitude, creating an imaginary line between the northern and southern hemispheres of the globe. Going one step further, the data about world cities retieved from the Open Weather API is used to plan future vacations in world cities only with ideal weather conditions.
