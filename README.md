# Python API Challenge - What's the weather like? 

## Background ##

Using Python requests, APIs and JSON traversals, the following weather analysis answers the questsion __"What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"__. Using data from the [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api), the previously stated question is answered by getting data about 500+ world cities with varying distance from the equator, which is located at 0&deg; latitude, creating an imaginary line between the northern and southern hemispheres of the globe. Going one step further, the data about world cities retieved from the Open Weather API, along with [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/overview) and jupyter-gmaps is used to plan future vacations in world cities only with ideal weather conditions.
